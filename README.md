 Time Series Analysis Cryptocurrency
 
This project aims to study the degree of which Bitcoin and fiat money affect the values of various cryptocurrencies. It is with hopes that such a study will help to quantify the degree of influence Bitcoin and fiat money has on the crypto-market, to reduce and quantify risk, and aid in prediction of future price movements of it.

In short, our project aims to:
1) Quantify the degree of influence Bitcoin has on other smaller cryptocurrencies.
2) Model long and short term relationships between Bitcoin, small cryptocurrencies and fiat money.
3) Extract insights on portfolio management; for example, is it better to keep assets in Bitcoin, or move to a smaller cryptocurrency when the US Dollar is in a volatile        state?

The data used in this project was collected from Yahoo Finance. The data was available for download as a CSV. 

The data was collected from 3rd of April 2017 to the 3rd of April 2021. For all cryptocurrencies, there were 4 dates (17/4/20, 9/10/20, 12/10/20, 13/10/20) of data that were unavailable to be obtained from Yahoo Finance, and were instead filled in with values from CoinMarketCap.

For USD, data was occasionally unavailable for days that markets were closed during weekends and public holidays. The missing data was populated with the values from the previous market opening day as the USD closing price remains the same when the market is closed.
