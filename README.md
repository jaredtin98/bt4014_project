 Time Series Analysis Cryptocurrency
 
This project aims to study the degree of which Bitcoin and fiat money affect the values of various cryptocurrencies. It is with hopes that such a study will help to quantify the degree of influence Bitcoin and fiat money has on the crypto-market, to reduce and quantify risk, and aid in prediction of future price movements of it.

In short, our project aims to:
     1. Quantify the degree of influence Bitcoin has on other smaller cryptocurrencies.
     2. Model long and short term relationships between Bitcoin, small cryptocurrencies and fiat money.
     3. Extract insights on portfolio management; for example, is it better to keep assets in Bitcoin, or move to a smaller cryptocurrency when the US Dollar is in a volatile           state?
